# ps-exchange-searchanddestroy

This script can be used to go through a group of peoples ms exchange mailboxes, search for and delete a specific email, whilst returning the results of the searches to an admin mailbox for auditing.

This script can be useful in conjunction with the 'recall' email function in Outlook and Exchange. As well as recalling an email you can use this script to actually seek out and delete the email from any mailbox that might have already read the email prior to the recall.
